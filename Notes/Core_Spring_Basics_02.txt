Life cycle Methods of bean->
- Spring provides 2 important methods to every bean 
- public void init() , public void destroy()
- init() this method used for initialization code , loading , config , connecting db , webservice etc.
- desstroy() method is for clean up purpose means closing database conn and all these things

The proccess followed by IOC Container or Spring ->
- We create bean and configure it by xml file.
- IOC container will create an object of that bean or class
- It adds values through DI 
- calls init() method
- we are ready to read and use bean
- after performing all the activties it runs destroy() method
 ** Configuring init() and destroy() using following technique
- Xml
- Interfaces
- Annotations

# Using xml ->
-follow the same proccess as we have done in the past and simply add the init-method and destroy-method 
attribute to set init() and destroy() method in your container
- You need to define both the methods
To call the destroyer by container we can use AbstractApplicationContext container..
- the shutDownHook calls the destroyer method 

# Using Interfaces ->
- we have Initializingbean interface which has some methods to perform init() method you just need 
to overide these methods
- DisposableBean interface provides you destroy method..

# Using annotations ->
- @Postconstruct is used to call the methods after property construction done by IOC means for running 
init() method
- you need to specify context tag inside xml file to run all the annotation you have declared
