Autowiring In Spring ->
- It is a feature of spring framework in which spring Container adds dependencies autometically.
- It can not works with primitive data type values. It works only with reference type objects.
- when we inject object of one class into another this is wiring
# Autowiring using xml config->
1) byName -> in this method you specify name of your object in destination class and if any bean inside xml is present with same name
then your object will be injected in the destination bean.
it will check the name of object present in destination class then it find is there any 
bean present with same name. if present then it will be autowired.
2)byType -> check the classname basically type.  But what if you have declared
more than one beans of same type. In this case you will get error
3) constructor -> It checks the constructor of destination class whatever objects 
declared in that it will simply injects that objects.

#Autowiring using annotation
You can just add @Autowired annotation on variable name , constructor and setter method..
to inject object of one class to another.
- Try to keep name of the bean same as object name
- @Qualifier is used with @Autowired to tell the IOC container which bean to be injected inside 
destination class
