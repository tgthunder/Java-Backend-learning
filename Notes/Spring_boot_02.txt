@Restcontroller ->Used to create rest API
This is combination of 2 annotations 
1)@controller -> this is used for making a class as a spring MVC controller
2)@ResponseBody -> make sure that return value of every method converted 
into json and sent as a http response.

Now We are going to learn Rest Api in details -
:- Create a pojo class for making entries of journal..
:- now create a method to get all the journals inside controller of journal entry
(GetMapping)
:- create a map to store the id and journal entries.
Note- Method inside the controller class should be public so that it could be
accessed and invoked with the help of spring framework and hhtp requests.
select raw and json in the body of post request indicates the body will contain data
in json format. This allows server to parse and data accuratly.
:- (PostMapping) used to create or send data from request body it binds rquest 
body to java object (body data can be in JSON and XML format)
Actually you create a object of the class in which you have to store the data 
you pass this object as a paramter to PostMapping method with @RequestBody 
annotation..
now append/put values in Map/databse using PostMapping methods. return 
boolean values so that you would get confirm that data has inserted properly.
body content will always go with post not with get..
Note :- Dont create same endpoints it will make your spring boot confuse which 
method to run. so give porper routes.
- Now How can I get journaentries using specific id 
for this we use @pathvarible for passing dynamic data. please specify the data
type of varible properly.

:- deleteMapping (used to delete something )
in our case we want to delete an entry of journal by id.
