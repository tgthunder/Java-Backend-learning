Databases , JPA , ORM , MongoDB 


MongoDB -> NoSql database
- stores the data in collections which is equal to table in rdbms.
- It consits of fields which are same as colums in sql 
- It has documents which are equivalent to rows in sql.
- If database doesnt exist you can simply create new database using use database_name.
- db.Collection_name.insertOne({insert data like we insert in JSON}).
Above command will create new collection and insert one document.
- MongoDB adds unique id inside document to uniquely identify any document.
- You can get any document using keys in document.
- you can perform delete operation using deleteOne. This will delete entire document.
- you can perform update operation using updateOne , updateMany

ORM - object relational mapping.
- used to map java objects to database tables.
- you can work with databases with the help of oops. make it easier
to interact with databases.
Ways ->
JPA
JPA means Java Persistance API which provides interfaces and classes , 
annotations to achive ORM.
We can impliment JPA interface through Hibernate , EclipseLink , openJPA

** Spring Data JPA -> simplifies the working with JPA by providing higher
level abstractions and utilities. still you need JPA implimentation to use
spring Data JPA. such as hibernate , EclipseLink and openJPA.
- JPA is primarly designed to work with relational databases. Not with MongoDB

# To use mongoDB we can use Spring Data MongoDB. It serves as a persistance provider
- You just need to add the dependecy of Spring Data MongoDB
- query method DSL and criteria API these are the 2 ways using which we can interact with 
databases.

# MongoDB SetUp for Spring Boot ->
- add dependecy of spring boot MongoDB in pom.xml
- now write the connection properties inside resources directory 
of your maven project so that @SpringBootApplication could 
understand using @EnableAutoConfiguration. It will automatically 
configure the mongoDB
- currently we are on localhost so we dont need any authentication
and autherization so no need to write username and password.
